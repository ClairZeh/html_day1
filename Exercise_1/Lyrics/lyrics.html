    [Chorus]
<br>
    <div>Sing me a song of a lass that is gone</div>
    <span>Say, could that lass be I?</span>
    <div>Merry of soul she sailed on a day</div>
    <div>Over the sea to Skye</div>
<br>
    <div>Mull was astem, Rum on the port</div>
    <span>Eigg on the starboard bow:</span>
    <div>Glory of youth glowed in her soul:</div>
    <div>Where is that glory now?</div>
<br>
    [Chorus]
<br>
<br>
    <div>Sing me a song of a lass that is gone</div>
    <span>Say, could that lass be I?</span>
    <div>Merry of soul she sailed on a day</div>
    <div>Over the sea to Skye</div>
<br>   
   <div>Give me again all that was there</div>
   <span>Give me the sun that shone</span>
    <div>Give me the eyes, give me the soul</div>
    <div>Give me the lass that's gone.</div>
<br>
    [Chorus]
<br>
<br>
    <div>Sing me a song of a lass that is gone</div>
    <span>Say, could that lass be I?</span>
    <div>Merry of soul she sailed on a day</div>
    <div>Over the sea to Skye</div>
<br>   
    <div>Billow and breeze, islands and seas</div>
    <span>Mountains of rain and sun</span>
    <div>All that was good, all that was fair All that was me is gone.</div>
<br>
    [Chorus]
<br>
<br>
    <div>Sing me a song of a lass that is gone</div>
    <span>Say, could that lass be I?</span>
    <div>Merry of soul she sailed on a day</div>

    [Chorus]
<br>
<br>
    <div>Sing me a song of a lad that is gone,</div>
    <span>Say, could that lass be I?</span>
    <div>Merry of soul she sailed on a day</div>
    <div>Over the sea to Skye</div>
<br>
   <div>Mull was astern, Rum on the port,</div>
   <span>Eigg on the starboard bow,</span>
   <div>Glory of youth glowed in his soul,</div>
   <div>Where is that glory now?</div>
<br>
    <div>Give me again all that was there,</div>
    <span>Give me the sun that shone!</span>
    <div>Give me the eyes, give me the soul,</div>
    <div>Give me the lad that's gone!</div>
<br>

<br>
   <div>Billow and breeze, islands and seas,</div>
    <div>Mountains of rain and sun,</div>
    <div>All that was good, all that was fair,</div>
    <div>All that was me is gone.</p></div>
